- Pxp_document: Add hooks that can be set by the user for:
    * post_add
    * pre_delete
  This would be useful for automatically maintaining an index
  of elements (by name), if this is required.

- Pxp_dtd: Add class type for dtd

- Finish pxp_xpath. Add support in preprocessor for XPath expressions.

  The functor should get a set of nodes as argument, so one can experiment
  with various set implementations.
