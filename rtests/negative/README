Regression test "negative":
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- An errorneous XML file is parsed, and the error message is printed.

- The output is compared with a reference file. The test is only
  passed if the output and the reference are equal.

- Test data "data_jclark_notwf":
  Contains the samples by James Clark that are not well-formed. 
  The subdirectories:
  - sa:           standalone documents
  - not-sa:       non-standalone document (with external DTD)
  - ext-sa:       non-standalone document (with other external entity)

- Test data "data_jclark_invalid":
  Contains the samples by James Clark that are invalid.

- Tests that are not passed have been moved into the *-problems directories.
  The reason is typically that characters have been used not in the 
  Latin 1 character set.

- Test data "data_notwf":
  Contains own tests with samples that are not well-formed.
