reported bugs have been fixed.

001.xml		2000-08-26: Haruo's single quote bug. Attvalues delimited
		by single quotes did not work for the UTF-8 lexer.
002+.xml	2000-08-26: Haruo's file-names-are-not-URLs bug. from_file
		interpreted the file name as URL-encoded string. "002+.xml"
		because the "+" must not be decoded as space.
003.xml		2000-08-26: Alain's bug that data nodes must not be merged
		where PI nodes are created. In the "comments" directory
		there is another test for the case that comments delimit
		data material
