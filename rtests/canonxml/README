Regression test "canonxml":
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- An XML file is parsed, and the contents are printed in a canonical
  format.

- The output is compared with a reference file. The test is only
  passed if the output and the reference are equal.

- Test data "data_jclark_valid":
  Contains the samples by James Clark that are valid. The subdirectories:
  - sa:           standalone documents
  - not-sa:       non-standalone document (with external DTD)
  - ext-sa:       non-standalone document (with other external entity)

  Tests that are not passed have been moved into the *-problems directories.
  The reason is typically that characters have been used not in the 
  Latin 1 character set.
