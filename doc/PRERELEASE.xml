<readme title="README - PXP, the XML parser for O'Caml">
  <sect1>
    <title>Pre-release of PXP, the XML parser for O'Caml</title>

    <p>PXP is the new, completely revised and partly rewritten 
validating XML parser
for O'Caml; the old name, "Markup", has been dropped. PXP is not yet
stable and currently being developed, but pre-releases are available
(see below). If you want to develop serious software for PXP, please
use the stable release "Markup 0.2.10" which is still available. The
intention of the pre-release is to show the direction of the current
work, and not to provide a useable software component.
</p>

    <p>PXP will retain most parts of Markup's API; the name PXP 
emphasizes the strengths of the API: it is the Polymorphic XML Parser.
The document objects representing the parsed file have an interesting
polymorphism which allows that the user of the parser can control
which kind of objects are actually created. The current API supports
the element type as criterion for object/class selection; future APIs will
extend this concept such that arbitrary criterions are possible
(e.g. you may want to have different classes for different namespaces).
</p>

    <p>The current development goals of PXP are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Full XML-1.0 conformance:</em> The last stable release
is not able to handle Unicode characters in a reasonable way. Furthermore,
some validation checks have been left out.</p>

	<p>The current pre-release can read files encoded as UTF-8,
UTF-16 and ISO-8859-1, and it can represent the document internally
using UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 strings. This was only possible 
because Claudio Sacerdoti Coen  contributed a special lexer preprocessor
hiding the details of the UTF-8 encoding.
</p>

	<p>The current pre-release can now check the standalone declaration.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><em>Correctness of validation:</em> The well-formedness
and valididity constraints must be implemented as correct as possible.
The last stable release had already a regression test covering many
aspects of XML. The test suite will be extended.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><em>Parsing performance:</em> It should be possible to
process large amounts of data in a reasoable period of time. The last
stable release had many stages of processing that wasted time.</p>

	<p>The current pre-release is already 30 per cent faster than
the last stable release.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><em>Simplicity of usage:</em> Unlike parsers basing on
imperative languages and DOM, the usage of PXP should be simple, even
for complex tasks. The current parser API has already many advantages
over DOM; especially it is well integrated into the functional and
object-oriented language O'Caml. You do not have to deal with
artificial representations like "node lists" while the programming
environment already provides good support for list structures. The
fact that O'Caml allows a functional programming style is interesting
for programs transforming XML trees.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Download the PXP pre-release</title>

    <p>The current pre-release is available under 
<a href="&url.gps-ocaml-download;/pxp-pre-0.99.2.tar.gz">
&url.gps-ocaml-download;/pxp-pre-0.99.2.tar.gz</a>. There is currently no
documentation for this version of the software; it is recommended to use the <a
href="&url.markup-manual;">Markup manual</a> and compare it with the current
module interfaces.</p>

    <p>Please note that this is work in progress; it contains bugs
and irregularities.</p>

    <p>The parser works only with OCaml-3.</p>

    <p>I am very interested in your opinion to PXP; please <a
