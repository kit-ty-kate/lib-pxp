    <p>
<em>PXP</em> is a validating parser for XML-1.0 which has been written
entirely in Objective Caml. <em>This page contains development information
for PXP; if you are looking for the stable distribution, please go
<a href="&url.pxp-project;">here</a>.</em>

    <title>Version History</title>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em>1.0.98.4:</em></p>
	<p>New support for PUBLIC identifiers in Pxp_reader: The functions
resolve_public_id_as_file and resolve_public_id_as_string lookup PUBLIC
identifiers in a catalog (implemented as associative list). However, there
is still no way to load a catalog from a file.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><em>1.0.98.3:</em></p>
	<p>A single fix (again line numbering) that only applies to the
ocamlopt version. The symptom was an "array-out-of-bounds" runtime error.
</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><em>1.0.98.2:</em></p>
	<p>Corrects a bug with incorrect line numbering that was in
1.0.98.1.</p>
	<p>This version contains numerous optimizations, making the 
parser clearly faster. I had some gprof sessions, and it was possible
to reduce the amount of temporarily allocated memory. One important result is
that the option errors_with_line_numbers could be removed; line counting
is now very cheap.
</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><em>1.0.98.1:</em></p>
	<p>The memory consumption of the node objects has been reduced.</p>
	<p>There is now a string pool option in type Pxp_yacc.config which
makes it likely that equal strings share the same memory block.
This option is experimental.</p>

	<p>There is now support for Alains lexer generator wlex. This is
currently very experimental. To enable wlex you must change the variable
LEX_IMPL in Makefile.conf and recompile everything.  wlex is available here:
http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/frisch/soft</p>

	<p>Pxp_marshal contains functions to (un)serialize node trees and
documents.  Loading the binary format is faster than parsing the XML source;
applications are inter-process communication, and loading constant XML texts
very quickly.</p>

	<p>Several bug fixes (but no serious bugs have been found yet).</p>
