This directory contains GODI build instructions to compile and install
the latest SVN version of PXP. To access these instructions,
proceed as follows:

- Type "make" in this directory. This creates two files:

  godi-pxp-<Version>.build.tgz
  available.new

- Copy these files into a directory that can be accessed by
  http.

  In my environment, I just create a symlink from
  ~/public_html/godi-pxp to this directory, so the
  files are accessible at the URL
  http://ice/~gerd/godi-pxp

- Edit your godi.conf file, and add this line:

  GODI_BUILD_SITES += http://ice/~gerd/godi-pxp

  Of course, use the URL that accesses the mentioned directory,
  not my URL. (Read on for a public URL.)

Now start godi_console. The package update recognizes that there
is a second directory with source packages, and merges them with
the main list of packages. You can then just build godi-pxp.

Note that you need access to the SVN (https) port (443) from
your network (ask your sysadmin).
