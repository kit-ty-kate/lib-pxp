How to compile: "make clean && make depend && make && make opt"

Usage: "cat input.mll | ./ucs2_to_utf8 > output.mll"
 where in input.mll there are definitions of ucs2 regular expressions
 and in output.mll there are the same utf8 regular expressions in the
 format expected by ocamllex

 See input/input.mll for an example (the definitions are taken from the
 appendix B of the XML reccomendation) and input/example.mll for a
 smaller one.
