{b Editorial note:} The PXP tree API has some complexity. The
definition in {!Pxp_document} is hard to read without some background
information. This introduction is supposed to give it. However, it
is not a tutorial, and the reader won't find easy recipes in it.

{1 The structure of document trees}

In a document parsed with the default parser settings every node represents
either an element or a character data section. There are two classes
implementing the two aspects of nodes: {!Pxp_document.element_impl},
and {!Pxp_document.data_impl}. There are configurations which allow more
node types to be created, in particular processing instruction nodes,
comment nodes, and super root nodes, but these are discussed later.
Note that you can always add these extra node types yourself to the node tree
no matter what the parser configuration specifies.

The following figure 
shows an example how
a tree is constructed from element and data nodes. The circular areas 
represent element nodes whereas the ovals denote data nodes. Only elements
may have subnodes; data nodes are always leaves of the tree. The subnodes
of an element can be either element or data nodes; in both cases the O'Caml
objects storing the nodes have the class type {!Pxp_document.node}.

{picture ../pic/node_term.gif 
A tree with element nodes, data nodes, and attributes}

Attributes (the clouds in the picture) do not appear as nodes of the
tree, and one must use special access methods to get them.

You would get such a tree by parsing with
{[
  let config = Pxp_types.default_config
  let source = Pxp_types.from_string 
                  "<a att=\"apple\"><b><a att="\"orange\">An orange</a>Cherries</b><c/></a>"
  let spec = Pxp_tree_parser.default_spec
  let doc = Pxp_tree_parser.parse_document_entity config source spec
  let root = doc#root
]}

The [config] record sets a lot of parsing options. A number of these
options are explained below. The [source] argument says from where
the parsed text comes. For the mysterious [spec] parameter see below.

The parser returns [doc], which is a {!Pxp_document.document}. You
have to call its [root] method to get the root of the tree. Note that
there are other parsing functions that return directly nodes; these
are intended for parsing XML fragments, however. For the usual closed
XML documents use a function that returns a document.

The [root] is, as other nodes of the tree, an object instance of the
{!Pxp_document.node} class type.

What about other things that can occur in XML text? As mentioned,
by default only elements and data nodes appear in the tree, but it is
possible to enable more node types by setting appropriate 
{!Pxp_types.config} options:

- Comments are ignored by default. By setting the config option
[enable_comment_nodes], however, comments are added to the tree. There is a
special node type for comments.
- Processing instructions (denoted by [<? ... ?>] parentheses) are
not ignored, but normally no nodes are created for them. The
instructions are only gathered up, so one can check for their
presence but not for their exact location. By setting the
config option [enable_pinstr_nodes], however, processing instructions
are added to the tree as normal nodes. There is also a special node
type for them.
- Usually, the topmost element is the root of the tree. There is, however,
the difficulty that the XML syntax allows one to surround
the topmost element
by comments and processing instructions. For an exact 
representation of this, it is possible to put an artificial root
node at the top of the tree, so that the topmost element is one of
the children, and the other surrounding material appears as the other
children. This mode is enabled by setting [enable_super_root_node].
The node is called super root node, and is also a special type of node.
- It is possible to also get attributes and even namespaces as
node objects, but they are never put into the regular tree. To get
these very special nodes, one has to use special access methods.
- CDATA sections (like [<![CDATA[some text]]>]) are simply added to the
surrounding data node,
so they do not appear as nodes of their own.
- Entity references (like [&amp;]) are automatically resolved, and
the resolution is added to the surrounding node

The parser collapses as much data material into one
data node as possible such that there are normally never two adjacent data
nodes. This invariant is enforced even if data material is included by entity
references or CDATA sections, or if a data sequence is interrupted by
comments. So 

{[ a &amp; b <!-- comment --> c <![CDATA[<> d]]> ]}

is represented by only one data node, for
instance (for the default case where no comment nodes are created).
Of course, you can create document trees manually which break this
invariant; it is only the way the parser forms the tree.

All types of nodes are represented by the same Ocaml objects of 
class type {!Pxp_document.node}. The method 
{!Pxp_document.node.node_type} returns
a hint which type of node the object is. See the type
{!Pxp_document.node_type} for details how the mentioned node types are
reflected by this method. For instance, for elements this method
returns [T_element n] where [n] is the name of the element.

Note that this means formally that all access methods are implemented
for all node types. For example, you can get the attributes of 
data nodes by calling the {!Pxp_document.node.attributes} method, 
although this does not
make sense. This problem is resolved on a case-by-case basis by
either returning an "empty value" or by raising appropriate
exceptions (e.g. {!Pxp_types.Method_not_applicable}).
For the chosen typing it is not possible to define slimmer class types
that better fit the various node types.

Attributes are usually represented as pairs
[string * att_value] of names and values. Here,
[att_value] is a conventional variant type. There are lots of
access methods for attributes, see below. It is optionally possible
to wrap the attributes as nodes (method
{!Pxp_document.node.attributes_as_nodes}), but even in this case the attributes
are outside the regular document tree.

Normally, the processing instructions are also not included
into the document tree. They are considered as an extra property of the
element containing them, and can be retrieved by the
{!Pxp_document.node.pinstr}
method of the element node. If this way of handling processing instructions
is not exact enough, the parser can optionally create processing instruction
nodes that are regular members of the document tree.

{2 Access methods}

An overview over some relevant access methods:

{ul
  {- {b General:}
    {ul
      {- [dtd] ({!Pxp_document.node.dtd}): returns the DTD object.
         All nodes have such an object, even in well-formed mode.}
      {- [encoding] ({!Pxp_document.node.encoding}): returns the
         encoding of the in-memory document representation.}
    }}
  {- {b Navigation:}
    {ul
      {- [parent] ({!Pxp_document.node.parent}): returns the parent object
         of the node it is called on}
      {- [root] ({!Pxp_document.node.root}): returns the root of the tree
         the node is member of}
      {- [sub_nodes] ({!Pxp_document.node.sub_nodes}): returns the children
         of the node }
      {- [previous_node] ({!Pxp_document.node.previous_node}): returns the
         left sibling}
      {- [next_node] ({!Pxp_document.node.next_node}): returns the
         right sibling}
     }}
  {- {b Information:}
    {ul
      {- [node_position] ({!Pxp_document.node.node_position}): returns the
         ordinal position of this node as child of the parent}
      {- [node_path] ({!Pxp_document.node.node_path}): returns the positional
         path of this node in the whole tree}
      {- [node_type] ({!Pxp_document.node.node_type}): returns the type of
         the node}
      {- [position] ({!Pxp_document.node.position}): returns the position
         of the node in the parsed XML text}
     }}
  {- {b Content:}
    {ul
      {- [data] ({!Pxp_document.node.data}): returns the data contents of
         data nodes}
      {- [attributes] ({!Pxp_document.node.attributes}): returns the attributes
         of elements}
      {- [attributes_as_nodes] ({!Pxp_document.node.attributes_as_nodes}):
         also returns the attributes, but represented as a list of nodes
         residing outside the tree }
      {- [comment] ({!Pxp_document.node.comment}): returns the text of the
         XML comment }
    }}
  {- {b Validation:}
    {ul 
      {- [validate] ({!Pxp_document.node.validate}): validates the element
         locally }
     }}
  {- {b Namespace:} (Only if namespaces are enabled, and the namespace-aware
        node implementation is used)
    {ul
      {- [localname] ({!Pxp_document.node.localname}): returns the local name
         of the element in the namespace }
      {- [namespace_uri] ({!Pxp_document.node.namespace_uri}): returns the
         namespace URI of the node }
      {- [namespace_scope] ({!Pxp_document.node.namespace_scope}): returns
         the scope object with more namespace query methods }
      {- [namespaces_as_nodes] ({!Pxp_document.node.namespaces_as_nodes}):
         returns the namespaces this node is member of, and the namespaces
         are represented as list of nodes}
    }}
  }

{2 Mutation methods}

Trees are mutable, and nodes are mutable. Note that the tree is not 
automatically (re-)validated when it is changed. You have to explicitly
call validation methods, or the {!Pxp_document.validate} function for the
whole tree.

{ul
  {- {b Building trees, changing the structure of trees:}
    {ul
      {- [append_node] ({!Pxp_document.node.append_node}): appends a
        node as new child to this node }
      {- [remove] ({!Pxp_document.node.remove}): removes this node from
        the tree }
    }}
  {- {b Changing the content of nodes:}
    {ul
      {- [set_data] ({!Pxp_document.node.set_data}): changes the contents
        of data nodes }
      {- [set_attribute] ({!Pxp_document.node.set_attribute}): adds or
        changes an attribute }
      {- [set_comment] ({!Pxp_document.node.set_comment}): changes the
        contents of comment nodes }
    }}
  {- {b Creating nodes:}
    {ul
      {- [create_element] ({!Pxp_document.node.create_element}):
         called on an element node, this method creates a new tree only
         consisting of an element, and the only node of the tree is an
         object of the same class as this node}
      {- [create_data] ({!Pxp_document.node.create_date}): same for data
         nodes }
      {- [orphaned_clone] ({!Pxp_document.node.orphaned_clone}):
         creates a copy of the subtree starting at this node }
    }}
}

{2 Links between nodes}

The node tree has links in both directions: Every node has a link to its
parent (if any), and it has links to the subnodes (see the following
picture). Obviously,
this doubly-linked structure simplifies the navigation in the tree; but has
also some consequences for the possible operations on trees.

{picture ../pic/node_general.gif 
Nodes are doubly linked trees}

(Definitions: {!Pxp_document.node.parent}, {!Pxp_document.node.sub_nodes}.)

Because every node must have at most {b one} parent node,
operations are illegal if they violate this condition. The following figure
shows on the left side
that node [y] is added to [x] as new subnode
which is allowed because [y] does not have a parent yet. The
right side of the picture illustrates what would happen if [y]
had a parent node; this is illegal because [y] would have two
parents after the operation.

{picture ../pic/node_add.gif 
A node can only be added if it is a root}

(Definition: {!Pxp_document.node.append_node}.)

The [remove] operation simply removes the links between two nodes. In the
following picture the node
[x] is deleted from the list of subnodes of
[y]. After that, [x] becomes the root of the
subtree starting at this node.

{picture ../pic/node_delete.gif
A removed node becomes the root of the subtree}

(Definition: {!Pxp_document.node.remove}.)

It is also possible to make a clone of a subtree; illustrated in the
next picture. In this case, the
clone is a copy of the original subtree except that it is no longer a
subnode. Because cloning never keeps the connection to the parent, the clones
are called {b orphaned}.

{picture ../pic/node_clone.gif 
The clone of a subtree}

(Definition: {!Pxp_document.node.orphaned_clone}.)

{2 Optional features of document trees}

As already pointed out, the parser does only create element and data nodes by
default. The configuration of the parser can be controlled by the 
{!Pxp_types.config} record. There are a number of optional features that
change the way the document trees are constructed by the parser:

Note that the parser configuration only controls the parser. If
you create trees of your own, you can simply add all the additional node types
to the tree without needing to enable these features.

{ul
{- When [enable_super_root_node] is set, the extra super root node
is generated at the top of the tree. This node has type [T_super_root].}
{- The option [enable_comment_nodes] lets the
parser add comment nodes when it parses comments. These nodes have
type [T_comment].}
{- The option [enable_pinstr_nodes] changes the
way processing instructions are added to the document. Instead of appending
such instructions to their containing elements as additional properties, this
mode forces the parser to create real nodes of type [T_pinstr] for them.}
{- The option [drop_ignorable_whitespace] (enabled by default) can
be turned off. It controls whether the parser skips over so-called ignorable
whitespace. The XML standard allows that elements contain whitespace 
characters even if they are declared in the DTD not to contain character data. 
Because of this, the parser considers such whitespace as ignorable detail 
of the XML instance, and drops the characters silently. You can change
this by setting [drop_ignorable_whitespace] to [false]. In
this case, every character of the XML instance will be accepted by the
parser and will be added to a data node of the document tree.}
{- By default, the parser creates elements with an annotation
about the location in the XML source file. You can query this location by
calling the method [position]. As this requires a lot of
memory, it is possible to turn this off by setting
[store_element_positions] to [false].}
}

There are a number of further configuration options; however,
these options do not change the structure of the document tree. 

{2 Optional features of nodes}

The following features exist per node, and are simply invoked by
using the methods dealing with them.

{ul
{- Attribute nodes: These are useful 
if you want to have data structures that contain
attributes together with other types of nodes. The method
[attributes_as_nodes] returns the attributes wrapped into node
objects. Note that these nodes are read-only.}
{- Validation: The document
nodes contain the routines validating the document body. Of course, the
validation checks depend on what is stored in the DTD object. 
(There is always a DTD object - even in well-formedness mode, only
that it is mostly empty then, and validation is a no-op.)

The DTD object contains the declarations of
elements, attribute lists, entities, and notations. Furthermore, the 
DTD knows
whether the document is flagged as "standalone". As a PXP extension to
classic XML processing, the DTD may specify a mixed mode between
"validating mode" and "well-formedness mode". It is possible to allow
non-declared elements in the document, but to check declared elements 
against their declaration at
the same time. Moreover, there is a similar feature for attribute lists; 
you can allow non-declared attributes and check declared attributes. 
(Well, the
whole truth is that the parser always works in this mix mode, and that
the "validating mode" and the "well-formedness mode" are only the extremes
of the mix mode.)}
}

{2 Creating nodes and trees}

Often, the parser creates the trees, but on occasion it is useful to
create trees manually. We explain here only the basic mechanism. There
is a nice camlp4 syntax extension called pxp-pp (XXX: LINK) allowing
for a much better notation in programs.

The most basic way of creating new nodes are the [create_element],
[create_data], and [create_other] methods of nodes. It is not recommended
to use them directly, however, as they are very primitive.

In the {!Pxp_document} module there are a number of functions creating
individual nodes (without children), the node constructors:

- {!Pxp_document.create_element_node}: creates an element node
- {!Pxp_document.create_data_node}: creates a data node
- {!Pxp_document.create_comment_node}: creates a comment node
- {!Pxp_document.create_pinstr_node}: creates a processing instruction node
- {!Pxp_document.create_super_root_node}: creates a super root node

There are no functions to create attribute and namespace nodes - these
are always created automatically by their containing nodes, so the user
does not need to do anything for creating them.

The node constructors must be equipped with all required data to
create the requested type of node. This includes the data that would
have been available in the textual XML representation, and some of the
meta data passed to the parsers, and meta data implicitly generated by
the parsers. For an element, this is at minimum:

- The name of the element (e.g. the "foo" in [<foo>])
- The attributes of the element
- The DTD object to use (a rudimentary DTD object is even required if only 
  well-formedness checks will be applied but no validation)
- The specification which classes are instantiated to create the nodes

For the latter two, see below. Optionally one can provide:

- The position of the element in the XML text
- Whether the attribute list is to be validated at creation time
- Whether name pools are to be used for the attributes

Regarding validation, the default is to validate local data such as 
attributes, but to omit any checks of the position the node has in the
tree. The tree is still a singleton, and consists only of one node
after creation, so non-local checks do not make sense.

After some nodes have been created, they can be combined to more complex
trees by mutation methods (e.g. {!Pxp_document.node.append_node}).

As mentioned, a node must always be connected with a DTD object, even
if no validation checks will be done. It is possible to create DTD objects
that do not impose restrictions on the document:

{[ 
  let dtd = Pxp_dtd_parser.create_empty_dtd config
  dtd # allow_arbitrary
]}

Even such a DTD object can contain entity definitions, and can demand
a certain way of dealing with namespaces. Also, the character encoding
of the nodes is taken from the DTD. See {!Pxp_dtd.dtd} for DTD methods,
and {!Pxp_dtd_parser} for convenient ways to create DTD objects. Note
that all nodes of a tree must be connected to the same DTD object.

PXP is not restricted to using built-in classes for nodes. When the
parser is invoked and a tree is built, it is looked up in a so-called
{b document model specification} how the new objects have to be
created (type {!Pxp_document.spec}. Basically, it is a list of sample
objects to use (which are called {b exemplars}), and these objects are
cloned when a node is actually created.

When calling the node constructors directly (bypassing the parser),
the document model specification has also to be passed to them as
argument. It is used in the same way as the parser uses it.

For getting the built-in classes without any modification, just use
{!Pxp_tree_parser.default_spec}. For the variant with enabled namespaces,
prefer {!Pxp_tree_parser.default_namespace_spec}.

{2 Namespaces}

PXP supports namespaces (but they have to be explicitly enabled). 
In order to simplify the handling
of namespace-aware documents PXP applies a transformation to the document
which is called "prefix normalization". This transformation ensures that every
namespace prefix uniquely identifies a namespace throughout the whole document.

A namespace is identified by a namespace URI (e.g. something like
"http://company.org/namespaces/project1" - note that this URI is simply
processed as string, and never looked up by an HTTP access). For
brevity of formulation, one has to define a so-called namespace prefix
for such a URI. For example:

{[ <x:q xmlns:x="http://company.org/namespaces/project1">...</q> ]}

The "xmlns:x" attribute is special, and declares that for this
subtree the prefix "x" is to be used as replacement for the long
URI. Here, "x:q" denotes that the element "q" in this namespace "x"
is meant.

The problem is now that the URI defines the namespace, and not the
prefix. In another subtree you may want to use the prefix "y" for the
same namespace. This has always made it difficult to deal with namespaces
in XML-processing software.

PXP, however, performs prefix normalization before it returns the
tree. This means that all prefixes are changed to a norm prefix for
the namespace. This can be the first prefix used for the namespace,
or a prefix declared with a PXP extension, or a programmatically
declared binding of the norm prefix to the namespace.

In order to use the PXP implementation of namespaces, one has to
set [enable_namespace_processing] in the parser configuration, and
to use namespace-aware node implementations. If you don't use extended
node trees, this means to use {!Pxp_tree_parser.default_namespace_spec}
instead of {!Pxp_tree_parser.default_spec}. A good starting point
to enable all that:

{[
  let config = Pxp_types.default_namespace_config
  let source = ...
  let spec = Pxp_tree_parser.default_namespace_spec
  let doc = Pxp_tree_parser.parse_document_entity config source spec
  let root = doc#root
]}

The namespace-aware implementations of the [node]
class type define additional namespace methods like
[namespace_uri]. (Although you also could direct the parser to create 
non-namespace-aware nodes,
this does not make much sense, as you do not get these special access
methods then.)

The method [namespace_scope] allows one to get more information what
happened during prefix normalization. In particular, it is possible to
find out the original prefix in the XML text (which is also called
{b display prefix}), before it was mapped to the normalized prefix.
The [namespace_scope] method returns a
{!Pxp_dtd.namespace_scope} object with additional lookup methods.
