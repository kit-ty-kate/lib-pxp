I'm really surprised that my code is good enough to be mentioned in your book.
Of course, I'll grant you the permissions you need.

However, I would like you to call your attention to the fact that the "Markup" 
project has been superseded by the PXP project. More or less, "PXP" is the new
name for "Markup", and any updates of the code are released under the name
"PXP". 

There are currently two versions of the project:

- Markup version 0.2.10: This version is flagged as "stable", and I still
  recommend people who start using an XML parser to try this version first. I'm
  currently using it in some business projects, and it works very well.

- PXP version 0.99.6: This is the current development version. It has much more
  features, and complies much better to the XML-1.0 standard. However, the API
  of this version still changes from time to time, and it is not yet used for
  critical applications.

You can find additional information about PXP at this URL:
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/pxp-pre.html

I do not know the criterions on which you select code for inclusion into the
CDROM. Personally, I would like to see both parser versions on the CDROM.

Best regards,

Gerd Stolpmann
