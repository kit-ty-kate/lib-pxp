Hello everybody,

in the case you are interested in XML parsers: I  have written a new one,
called PXP, the Polymorphic XML Parser. It is programmed in Objective Caml, a
free functional programming language (caml.inria.fr).

PXP is a validating XML parser which strictly complies to the XML-1.0 standard.
The document is represented as object tree; the type of the node class can be 
customized. The polymorphism even allows it to select the class of the nodes
depending on the element types.

PXP is fast and reliable. It has been designed for CGI applications but is not
restricted to this domain. 

The parser has been written in the programming language Objective Caml, as this
is a stable, fast and expressive programming environment. It is addressed at
researchers who are already working with Objective Caml as well as at
interested industrial developers who want to leave the beaten paths of
industrial standards.

The software can be freely downloaded at the following homepage; it is covered
by a BSD-like open source license:

Have fun with it,

Gerd Stolpmann
