Hi Gerd,

I think I have found another bug in markup.

The file at the end of the mail is reported to be error-free,
but the root element is "Variable" when it should be "InductiveDefinition".
Do you check this in markup?  If not, why not?


And now, some statistics that may interest you:

I have parsed 1.3 Mb of XML Files with markup, a Perl interface to expat and
nsgml. Only markup and the last one are validating. These are the timings
I got:

markup (interpreted): 45 s
markup (native-code): 13 s
Perl + expat        : 13 s
nsgml               : 75 s

Now I'm parsing 76 Mb of XML Files and the timings I'm getting are

markup (interpreted): 20 m
markup (native-code):  6 m

The timings are not great, but markup is not too bad if faced with other
broad-used XML parsers. I think you have done quite a good job.

								T.I.A.

No, the file at the end has an error: The root element is declared as
"InductiveDefinition", but actually it is "Variable".

Really interesting. There are still some optimizations possible; for example
everything is actually scanned twice, first for the tokens, and in a second pass
the linefeeds are counted; this could be done in a single job. 

Were the files ISO-8859-1- or UTF-8 encoded? This makes really a difference
because the latter is much slower.

Did you use only XML::Parser for your Perl benchmark or XML::DOM?
XML::Parser is much more low-level than Markup whereas XML::DOM has more or
less the same functionality.

Perhaps you can get some speed-up by switching the validator off, i.e. using
Markup_yacc.parse_wf_entity. Depending on the DTD, validation can be
time-consuming.

Perhaps I didn't explain myself well. I know that the file had that error.
I'm saying that markupt DOES NOT tell me that there's an error.
You can check yourself by using the example "validate" distributed with markup.

Am I right or not?

ISO-8859-1

I used only XML::Parser with style Tree.

						Thank you again,

You are. I strongly believed that I included such a check, but I didn't...
Unfortunately, all test samples that could have proved that the check is missing
also have other errors, and these other errors are found first.

The updated archive, now version 0.2.2, is at the usual place
(http://people.darmstadt.netsurf.de/Gerd.Stolpmann/ocaml/markup-0.2.2.tar.gz).
