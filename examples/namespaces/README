This example demonstrates namespaces: it's a tiny macro preprocessor.
You can put <macro:define> statements into your XML code, and later
expand macros by <macro:use> statements. See macro.dtd for the DTD
and sample.xml for an example in XHTML.

Note that the preprocessor runs in a mode which is more than
well-formedness mode and less than validating mode. The DTD 
contained in the preprocessed XML text is replaced by macro.dtd
(except the general entities which are copied), and macro.dtd
specifies that the known parts of the macro language are validated,
and that all other elements and attributes are not validated.
For example, the preprocessor does not check whether sample.xml
is valid XHTML.

Using the preprocessor: Do

	./preprocess sample.xml

which prints the converted text to stdout.
