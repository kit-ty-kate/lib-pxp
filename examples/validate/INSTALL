This release of the pxpvalidate tool contains a bytecode executable.
It can be run an all systems on which the Objective Caml Runtime
Environment (ocamlre) is installed, the bytecode interpreter. You 
need EXACTLY ocamlre version 3.01.

To install pxpvalidate, just become root on your system and start
./setup.sh, an interactive installation script. (If you don't like
interactive setup programs, you can also run ./setup.sh -help to
get the options, and start ./setup.sh -batch options...)

For usage instructions, see pxpvalidate(1).
