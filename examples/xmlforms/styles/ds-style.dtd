     should be top-aligned, bottom-aligned, or centered.
     Normally, the width of an hbox is the sum of its members, but you can
     also widen a box by specifying the "width" attribute. This is a number
     with a dimension, e.g. "10.5 cm", "105 mm", "4.13 in". Other dimensions
     are "pt" (points) and "px" (pixels).
     If "width" is given, you may also set "halign" (see vbox for possible
     values).
